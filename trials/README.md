Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to clarify that I have created replicas of real-life websites solely for educational purposes and without any intention of commercial use. My name is Zyix, and I embarked on this project to enhance my skills in web development and design.

The websites I have replicated are intended for personal and educational use only. The content used in these projects is either self-created or obtained from open sources such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc. My goal is to gain practical experience and proficiency in web technologies.

I want to emphasize that this project does not aim to infringe upon the rights of real websites or to replace them in any way. On the contrary, I view these efforts as an opportunity for self-improvement and advancement in the field.

I kindly request your understanding and support in this matter. Please feel free to contact me immediately if you have any concerns or issues.

Best regards,

Zyix
